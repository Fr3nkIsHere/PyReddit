A Reddit Client in Python for Terminals

!["PyReddit Execution"](/media/PyReddit-1.gif "PyReddit Execution")

# Why?

I created this tool first because I had nothing to do, but most importantly
because I want to create something unique in my favorite language: [Python](https://python.org)üêç. 

# How to use it?

- Install Python 3.10 or above (to see your python version write on your terminal) 
    ```python3 --version``` or ```python --version```
- Download the last [Release](https://github.com/Fr3nkIsHere/PyReddit/releases) or clone this repository
- To be able to use all the features you need to install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)  

# TODO list

- <del>Search a Subreddit
- Post time index (for now only globally)
- <del>Better Video & Sound</del> _NB: yes, i know about video and audio desync_
- Better Search Index
- Post view
- Search a User
- More personalization
